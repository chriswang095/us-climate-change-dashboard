This folder contains data used in the Tableau dashboard after being cleaned and transformed via Python and ingested into DBeaver.
The dashboard leverages four categories of data: GHG emissions, ZEV sales, Vehicle registrations, and EV charging infrastructure. Each category is stored in a separate folder.
